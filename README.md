# VolcanoesMap-US
A python script which is given a text files which conatins volcanoes longitude and latitude in the US, and a JSON file which contains data about the world.By running the script the user will recieve a map of the world, which will prompt markers of the weherebouts of the volcanoes in the text file.

I have used pandas library inorder to manage the text file. In addition i used "folium" package to build the map and to create diffrent markers by the elevation of each volcanoe.
